### Significance of Generative AI

- **Generative AI model for text generation**: GPT (Generative Pre Trained Transformer)
- Image Generation:
  - Text to Image: DALL-E (data analysis learning with language model for generation and exploration)
  - From seed image or random input or From sketches make other images (Deep Fake Image) : **GAN** (Generative Adversarial Network) or Diffusion Models
-Audio Generation: Natural sounding speech / Text To speech synthesis. Eg WaveNet

**Generative AI applications:** 
- Content creation: Articles, blog post and marketing materials, visuals and videos.
- Condensing documents.
- Language translation
- Chatbots and virtual assistants.
